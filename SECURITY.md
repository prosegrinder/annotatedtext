# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are always applied to the latest major release
and may be included in release notes and CHANGELOG.md.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a potential security vulnerability please email 
[security@prosegrinder.com](mailto:security@prosegrinder.com?subject=%5BSecurity%5D%20annotatedtext) rather 
than creating a public issue on GitHub.
